# Microsoft 365 Copilot
**Date:** 3/20/2025
## Overview
The conversation revolves around the use of Microsoft 365 Copilot over the past year, discussing how it's been adopted, its effectiveness, practical applications, limitations, and challenges. Participants reflect on their experiences, share insights on its usage in both large and small organizations, and evaluate whether it justifies its cost.

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned
#### 1. General Usage Patterns and Adoption
 **Daily Productivity Gains:** &#8209; 
* [ ] The speaker finds Copilot indispensable for daily efficiency. It helps automate mundane tasks but doesn’t solve complex challenges.
* [ ] Business Productivity Focus: Copilot is primarily beneficial for automating everyday office tasks (emails, summarization, documentation) rather than deep technical problems or advanced AI applications.


**Organizational Setup Matters:**
&#8209;
* [ ] If an organization operates under a single Microsoft 365 tenant, Copilot has better access to internal data and enhances collaboration.
* [ ] In multi-tenant environments or isolated setups, the tool’s effectiveness declines significantly since it cannot fetch data across different tenants.
* [ ] Verification Required: Copilot’s automation speeds up workflows, but users must still verify outputs for accuracy, especially with sensitive or high-stakes data.

#### 2. Practical Applications & Real-World Use Cases
**Meeting Summarization & Follow-Ups:** &#8209;
* [ ] Copilot can summarize Teams meetings and extract action points, providing clarity on discussions   even during ongoing calls.
* [ ] The tool is useful for creating instant next steps at the end of meetings.
* [ ] Caveat: Summaries need validation as AI might miss critical details.

**Finding Internal Experts:** &#8209;

* [ ] Copilot helps identify colleagues with specific expertise by analyzing shared content (documents, presentations, past meetings).
* [ ] This networking feature is valuable in large organizations but less effective in smaller teams where expertise is already well known.

**Document & Knowledge Management:** &#8209;

* [ ] Users can build small AI-powered agents that focus on specific document sets (e.g., a SharePoint library), making it easier to extract insights from large reports.
* [ ] Particularly useful for quickly generating executive summaries of project documentation.

**Email & Chat Summaries:** &#8209;

* [ ] Copilot extracts key points from long email chains and Teams conversations, reducing the need to sift through extensive threads.
* [ ] Example: Employees returning from leave use it to catch up on key decisions instead of manually reading thousands of chat messages.

**Proposal Drafting & External Communication:** &#8209;

* [ ] Users generate concise summaries of complex documents (e.g., sales proposals) to include in emails, helping recipients grasp key points instantly.

#### 3. Challenges & Limitations
**A. Copilot’s Accessibility & Tenant Restrictions**

**Doesn't Work Across Tenants:** &#8209;

* [ ] Users working in multiple Microsoft 365 environments (e.g., consultants, external contractors, multi-business users) find Copilot inaccessible outside their primary tenant.
* [ ] Information from different customer environments, VDIs, and separate browser profiles is not integrated, reducing its effectiveness for consultants.

**No Integration with LinkedIn or External Networks:** &#8209;

* [ ] A suggested enhancement: If Copilot could search LinkedIn connections, it would be more powerful for finding expertise across organizations.
* [ ] Currently, users must rely on manual searches for external networking.

**B. Language & Localization Issues:** 
* [ ] While Copilot performs well in English, non-English users (e.g., Finnish speakers) report poor results in summarization and tone accuracy.
* [ ] If an AI-generated summary fails even once, users tend to lose trust and avoid using it again.

**C. User Adoption & Awareness Issues**

**Forgetting It Exists:** &#8209;

* [ ] Some users with Copilot licenses forget they have it or rarely engage with it, making it difficult to justify the cost.
* [ ] Similar to underutilized productivity apps, Copilot needs to be actively embedded into workflows to prove its value.

**Lack of Standardized Best Practices**

* [ ] Users often do not know how to maximize Copilot’s potential, leading to low adoption rates.
* [ ] Microsoft provides many new features, but users struggle to keep up with the updates.

**D. ROI (Return on Investment) & Cost Considerations**

**Pricing:** &#8209; 

* [ ] The cost of €25–30 per user per month (~€300+ annually) makes it a significant investment for organizations.


**Usage Justification:** &#8209;

* [ ] In smaller teams, Copilot’s value isn’t always clear, and renewal decisions are debated.
* [ ] Some companies buy licenses for everyone initially but later re-evaluate based on actual usage.
* [ ] Alternative Approach: Instead of company-wide adoption, organizations consider targeted deployments for specific teams.

**Productivity vs. Cost Analysis:** &#8209;

* [ ] Employees using Copilot extensively find it worthwhile, especially if it saves significant work hours.
* [ ] If adoption is sporadic, the subscription feels like an unnecessary expense.

#### 4. Feature Critiques & Unexpected Findings
**A. PowerPoint Slide Generator—More Hype Than Help?**


<mark>Many expected Copilot’s slide-generation feature to be a game-changer.</mark>

**In reality:**

* [ ] The slides look generic and unpolished.
* [ ] Editing pre-generated content feels less intuitive than building slides from scratch.
* [ ] Users feel AI-generated slides lack effort and strategic storytelling.
* [ ] Verdict: Better to create slides manually rather than rely on AI-generated ones.

**B. AI Summarization—Trust Issues & Comprehension Gaps**

* [ ] **Example Failure:** When asked to summarize critical work-related updates after a leave of absence, Copilot prioritized a colleague’s home plumbing issue as the top concern.
* [ ] **Reason:** AI misjudged urgency based on word context rather than business relevance.
* [ ] **Lesson:** Summaries still require human oversight to ensure accuracy.

**C. Microsoft's Ongoing Improvements**

* [ ] Copilot is constantly evolving, but updates are not always well-communicated to end users.
* [ ] Like Microsoft Paint, which has evolved over the years but remains perceived as a basic tool, Copilot is still seen as a "new" product even after a year.

## Final Reflections: Is Copilot Worth It?

**For Large Enterprises:** &#8209;

* [ ] Works best in single-tenant environments where all documents, emails, and meeting records are accessible.
* [ ] **Key benefits:** Summarization, knowledge retrieval, and automation of repetitive tasks.
* [ ] Justifiable if Copilot saves substantial work hours across teams.

**For Small Companies & Consultants:** &#8209;

* [ ] Value is less obvious, especially if most work happens outside a single Microsoft 365 tenant.
* [ ] Copilot cannot connect external environments, limiting its usefulness.
* [ ] A targeted approach (giving licenses only to those who will use it) is more cost-effective.

**For Individual Users:** &#8209;

* [ ] Highly dependent on personal workflows. If users do not make Copilot a habit, they won’t see its value.
* [ ] Awareness & training are critical for maximizing its potential.

## Conclusion: A Year Later, Copilot Is Promising but Not Yet Perfect

* [ ] Microsoft 365 Copilot is useful for structured, internal business workflows, but its tenant limitations, language issues, and sporadic adoption limit its broader appeal.
* [ ] Companies evaluating renewals should focus on actual usage metrics rather than blanket licensing.
* [ ] Future improvements could address cross-tenant collaboration, LinkedIn integration, and AI trust factors to enhance overall value.

In a year, users expect more refinements, better AI accuracy, and enhanced cross-system integrations. Until then, Copilot is helpful—but not yet indispensable—for everyone.
